= Kodi screensaver to turn off display

No Signal is a Kodi screensaver that puts your display off when in screen saver mode.

== How does it work ?
The screensaver causes 'no signal' to the display (beamer, monitor, TV) which eventually goes into sleep or turn off.

It supports the following methods:

- Raspberry Pi (vcgencmd)
- X11 DPMS (xset)
- DPMS (internal)
- CEC Standby (internal)

Optionally this screensaver can also log off your user.
