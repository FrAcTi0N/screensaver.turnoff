= Kodi screensaver to turn off display

No Signal is a Kodi screensaver that puts your display off when in screen saver mode.

== How does it work ?

It supports the following methods:

Raspberry Pi (vcgencmd)::
The screensaver causes 'no signal' using the vcgencmd utility. This only works on Raspberry Pi.

CEC Standby (internal)::
The screensaver forces the display to go into Standby using internal CEC controls.

DPMS (internal)::
The screensaver immediately forces the display off using internal DPMS (Energy Star) controls.

X11 DPMS (xset)::
The screensaver immediately forces the display off using the `xset` utility to set DPMS off state..


Optionally this screensaver can also log off your user.
